# Commit Message Guidelines

Use the following commit types for all commit messages, formatted as: `🔧 [build]`, `🧹 [chore]`, `👷 [ci]`, `📝 [docs]`, `✨ [feat]`, `🛠️ [fix]`, `⚡ [perf]`, `🚜 [refactor]`, `⏪ [revert]`, `🎨 [style]`, `🧪 [test]`

## Format Requirements

- Always start your commit message with the appropriate emoji and type in brackets
- Example: `"✨ [feat] Add dark mode toggle"`
- Each commit bullet point should start with one of those emojis (or create a new one if none fit)
- Each new topic in the commit should start with one of the emojis and tags
- Indent any lines that refer to the statement above with `" - "`

## Content Guidelines

- **Be as detailed as possible without being excessively wordy**
- **Always focus on source code changes over test/dev changes** if they're in the same commit
- **Always put source code changes above test/other changes**
- Parse every piece of code in this commit and think step by step about how it changes the program
- Be like an extremely detailed technical writer
- Use lots of emojis to help explain and visualize changes on every line
- Describe all changes comprehensively
